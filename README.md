# SpecUFEx Workflow

This is a workflow guide for using SpecuFEx, a waveform to clustered fingerprint algorithm introduced by Holtzman et al. (2018).

For more detailed information about the SpecUFEx algorithm, you can visit the [SpecUFEx GitHub repository](https://github.com/SpecUFex) and refer to the original publication by Holtzman et al. (2018).

## Workflow Steps


conda env create -f env.yaml

1. Set up environment
  - Clone this github repository by running the following command in Terminal:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/tsawi/SpecUFEx_workflow.git
  ```
  - Navigate to the main `SpecUFEx_workflow/` folder
  - Follow SpecUFEx installation instructions at the [SpecUFEx GitHub repository](https://github.com/SpecUFex)
  - Set up conda environment by running the following command in Terminal:
  ```
  conda env create -f env.yaml
  ```

2. Create a New YAML File:
   - Create a new `.yaml` file in the `data/yaml` directory.
   - Set the required parameters in this YAML file according to your experiment.

3. Run Python Scripts:

   - Interact with the Jupyter notebooks in `tutorial/`

   OR

   - Run the provided Python scripts in the `src/` directory in the order.
   - Start with `1_wfToSgramH5.py`, followed by `2_SpecUFEx.py`, and finally `3_Clustering.py`.
   - Provide the path to the previously created `.yaml` file as an argument.
   - For example:
     ```
     python3 1_wfToSgramH5.py ../data/yaml/demo/yaml
     ```


4. Save Figures:
   - The resulting figures are automatically saved in the `reports/figures` directory.

5. Experiment Adjustment:
   - If needed, adjust the parameters in the `.yaml` file to set up a new experiment.
   - After making changes, save the `.yaml` file.
   - Repeat the steps 2 and 3 to run and visualize the results of the new experiment.

Feel free to experiment with different settings, parameters, and data to explore the capabilities of SpecUFEx!
